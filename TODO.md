## ✅ [2024-01-XX] Fix Inconsistent Image Sizing in My Bookings Page
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Description**: Fixed inconsistent image sizing in the user's booking view where some images appeared small and others appeared large, creating an unprofessional appearance.

**Problem Identified**:
- Images in booking cards were displaying at their natural size instead of consistent dimensions
- Inline style `style={{ width: 'auto', height: 'auto' }}` was overriding CSS classes
- This caused visual inconsistency across different booking cards

**Changes Made**:

   - Removed the problematic inline style `style={{ width: 'auto', height: 'auto' }}`
   - Let CSS classes handle image sizing properly
   - Maintained existing width/height props for Next.js Image optimization

**CSS Structure (Already Present)**:
- `.bookingImage`: Fixed container size (120px x 80px on desktop, responsive on mobile)
- `.image`: Uses `object-fit: cover` for consistent aspect ratio
- Responsive breakpoints ensure proper sizing on all devices

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ **Consistent Image Size**: All booking images now display at uniform 120px x 80px
- ✅ **Proper Aspect Ratio**: Images maintain aspect ratio with `object-fit: cover`
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Images scale appropriately on mobile devices
- ✅ **Professional Appearance**: Clean, uniform layout across all booking cards
- ✅ **Performance Maintained**: Next.js Image optimization still works properly

**Responsive Behavior**:
- **Desktop**: 120px x 80px (3:2 aspect ratio)
- **Tablet**: 100px x 70px
- **Mobile Large**: 100px x 70px
- **Mobile Small**: Full width (180px height) for better visibility

## ✅ [2024-01-XX] Fix Authentication Error in My Bookings Page
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Description**: Fixed authentication error that was causing "Authentication Required" message to appear when customers tried to view their bookings, even when they were logged in.

**Problem Identified**:
- **Root Cause**: Frontend was not sending authentication token in the correct format
- **Issue**: Backend expected `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, but frontend was only sending token via cookies
- **Result**: Backend couldn't authenticate requests, showing 401 error and triggering error state
- **User Experience**: Customers saw confusing "Authentication Required" screen instead of their bookings

**Changes Made**:

1. **Updated `src/app/bookings/page.jsx`**:
   - **Fixed fetchBookings()**: Added proper `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` header to API requests
   - **Fixed cancelBooking()**: Ensured consistent token handling for booking cancellation
   - **Added Content-Type**: Added `'Content-Type': 'application/json'` header for better API compatibility
   - **Maintained existing cookie-based token retrieval**: Used `cookieUtils.getToken()` as before

**Technical Details**:
- **Before**: Frontend relied only on cookies for authentication
- **After**: Frontend sends token in Authorization header (industry standard)
- **Compatibility**: Backend already supported both methods, but header method is more reliable
- **Security**: No security changes - same token validation logic

**API Request Flow**:
```
Frontend → API: Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Backend ← Validates token from header
Returns bookings data successfully
```

**Error Handling**:
- ✅ **401 Response**: Properly handled with "session expired" message
- ✅ **Network Errors**: Graceful fallback with retry option
- ✅ **Token Refresh**: Automatic token cleanup on authentication failure
- ✅ **User Guidance**: Clear "Login" button when authentication fails

**Testing Status**: ✅ Ready for testing
- Verify users can now view their bookings without authentication errors
- Test booking cancellation functionality
- Check error handling for expired sessions
- Ensure login flow works properly when needed

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/bookings/page.jsx` - Fixed authentication header handling

**Benefits**:
- **Seamless User Experience**: Customers can view bookings without authentication issues
- **Proper Error Handling**: Clear messaging when authentication actually fails
- **Industry Standard**: Uses proper Authorization header format
- **Better Reliability**: More consistent authentication across different scenarios
- **User Trust**: Eliminates confusing error states for logged-in users
