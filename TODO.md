# Booking Loading Fix - Progress Tracking

## Issue
"Failed to load bookings. Please try again." - MissingSchemaError: Schema hasn't been registered for model "TopRoute"

## Root Cause
The TopRoute and Tour models were not imported in the bookings API route, causing Mongoose to not recognize them during populate operations.

## Completed Tasks
- âœ… **Analyzed the error** - Identified MissingSchemaError in bookings API route
- âœ… **Investigated models** - Verified TopRoute and Tour models exist and are properly defined
- âœ… **Fixed imports** - Added TopRoute and Tour imports to `src/app/api/bookings/route.js`

## Next Steps
- Test the booking loading functionality to verify the fix works
- Monitor for any other similar issues with other models

## Files Modified
- `src/app/api/bookings/route.js` - Added TopRoute and Tour model imports

## Status
ðŸ”§ **Fixed** - The import issue has been resolved. Bookings should now load properly.
